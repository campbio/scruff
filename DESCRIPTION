Description: A pipeline which processes single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) reads
    from CEL-seq and CEL-seq2 protocols. Demultiplex scRNA-seq FASTQ files,
    align reads to reference genome using Rsubread, and generate UMI filtered
    count matrix. Also provide visualizations of read alignments and pre- and
    post-alignment QC metrics.
