\description{
The following unfiltered PBMC_1k_v3 data were downloaded from
https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/datasets/3.0.0
/pbmc_1k_v3
Only the top 10 cells with most counts and the last 10 cells with non-zero
counts are included in this example.
This example only serves as a proof of concept and a tutoriol on how to
run the functions in this package. The results should not be
used for drawing scientific conclusions.
