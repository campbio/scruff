\usage{
tenxBamqc(
  bam,
  experiment,
  filter,
  validCb = NA,
  tags = c("NH", "GX", "CB", "MM"),
  yieldSize = 1e+06,
  outDir = "./",
  cores = max(1, parallel::detectCores() - 2)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{bam}{Paths to input BAM files generated by Cell Ranger pipeline. These
files are usually named \emph{"possorted_genome_bam.bam"} in the
 \emph{"outs"} folder of the top-level project output folders, respectively.}

\item{experiment}{A character vector of experiment names. Represents the
group label for each BAM file, e.g. "patient1, patient2, ...". The
length of \code{experiment} equals the number of BAM files to be processed.}

\item{filter}{Paths to the filtered barcode files. Should be in the same
length and order of the input BAM files. These files are named
\emph{"barcodes.tsv"} located at
\emph{outs/filtered_gene_bc_matrices/<reference_genome>/barcodes.tsv}.}

\item{validCb}{Path to the cell barcode whitelist file. By default uses the
file "737K-august-2016.txt" which is compatible with the v2 chemistry
protocol. The file can be inspected by calling
\code{data(validCb, package = "scruff")}. If the library is generated
using the v1 chemistry protocol, the path to the v1 barcode whitelist file
("737K-april-2014_rc.txt") needs to be provided. For library generated by
v3 chemistry protocol, path to "3M-february-2018.txt" is needed.}

\item{tags}{BAM tags used for collecting QC metrics. Contains
non-standard tags locally-defined by Cell Ranger pipeline. Should not be
changed in most cases.}

\item{yieldSize}{The number of records (alignments) to yield when drawing
successive subsets from a BAM file, providing the number of successive
records to be returned on each yield. This parameter is passed to the
\code{yieldSize} argument of the \code{BamFile} function in
\code{Rsamtools} package. Default is \strong{1e06}.}

\item{outDir}{Output directory. The location to write resulting QC table.}

\item{cores}{Number of cores used for parallelization. Default is
\code{max(1, parallel::detectCores() - 2)}, i.e. the number of available
cores minus 2.}
}
\value{
A \link[SingleCellExperiment]{SingleCellExperiment} object. The
 \code{colData} contains the number of aligned reads
 (reads_mapped_to_genome) and reads aligned
 to genes (reads_mapped_to_genes).
}
\description{
Read BAM file generated by Cell Ranger pipeline and output QC metrics
 including number of aligned reads and reads aligned to an gene.
