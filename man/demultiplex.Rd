\arguments{
\item{project}{The project name. Default is
\code{paste0("project_", Sys.Date())}.}

\item{experiment}{A character vector of experiment names. Represents the
group label for each FASTQ file, e.g. "patient1, patient2, ...". The number
of cells in a experiment equals the length of cell barcodes \code{bc}. The
length of \code{experiment} equals the number of FASTQ files to be
processed.}

\item{lane}{A character or character vector of flow cell lane numbers. FASTQ
files from lanes having the same \code{experiment} will be concatenated. If
FASTQ files from multiple lanes are already concatenated, any placeholder
would be sufficient, e.g. "L001".}

\item{read1Path}{A character vector of file paths to the read 1 FASTQ files.
These are the read files containing UMI and cell barcode sequences.}

\item{read2Path}{A character vector of file paths to the read 2 FASTQ files.
These read files contain genomic transcript sequences.}

\item{bc}{A character vector of pre-determined cell barcodes. For example,
see \code{?barcodeExample}.}

\item{bcStart}{Integer or vector of integers containing the cell barcode
start positions (inclusive, one-based numbering).}

\item{bcStop}{Integer or vector of integers containing the cell barcode
stop positions (inclusive, one-based numbering).}

\item{bcEdit}{Maximally allowed Hamming distance for barcode correction.
Barcodes with mismatches equal or fewer than this will be assigned a
corrected barcode if the inferred barcode matches uniquely in the provided
predetermined barcode list. Default is 0, meaning no cell barcode
correction is performed.}

\item{umiStart}{Integer or vector of integers containing the start positions
(inclusive, one-based numbering) of UMI sequences.}

\item{umiStop}{Integer or vector of integers containing the stop positions
(inclusive, one-based numbering) of UMI sequences.}

\item{keep}{Read trimming. Read length or number of nucleotides to keep for
read 2 (the read that contains transcript sequence information). Longer
reads will be clipped at 3' end. Shorter reads will not be affected.}

\item{minQual}{Minimally acceptable Phred quality score for barcode and UMI
sequences. Phread quality scores are calculated for each nucleotide in the
sequence. Sequences with at least one nucleotide with score lower than this
will be filtered out. Default is \strong{10}.}

\item{yieldReads}{The number of reads to yield when drawing successive
subsets from a fastq file, providing the number of successive records to be
returned on each yield. This parameter is passed to the \code{n} argument
of the \code{FastqStreamer} function in \emph{ShortRead} package. Default
is \strong{1e06}.}

\item{outDir}{Output folder path for demultiplex results. Demultiplexed
cell specifc FASTQ files will be stored in folders in this path,
respectively. \strong{Make sure the folder is empty.} Default is
\code{"./Demultiplex"}.}

\item{summaryPrefix}{Prefix for demultiplex summary filename. Default is
\code{"demultiplex"}.}

\item{overwrite}{Boolean indicating whether to overwrite the output
directory. Default is \strong{FALSE}.}

\item{cores}{Number of cores used for parallelization. Default is
\code{max(1, parallel::detectCores() - 2)}, i.e. the number of available
cores minus 2.}

\item{verbose}{Poolean indicating whether to print log messages. Useful for
debugging. Default to \strong{FALSE}.}

\item{logfilePrefix}{Prefix for log file. Default is current date and time
in the format of \code{format(Sys.time(), "\%Y\%m\%d_\%H\%M\%S")}.}
